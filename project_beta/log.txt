MODULE: 000 Computing feature from audio files
Extracting features from  segments starting at  (part 1 of 1) 
Feature extraction is done
MODULE: 00 verify training files
    Phase 1: Checking to see if the dict and filler dict agrees with the phonelist file.
        Found 14 words using 19 phones
    Phase 2: Checking to make sure there are not duplicate entries in the dictionary
    Phase 3: Check general format for the fileids file; utterance length (must be positive); files exist
    Phase 4: Checking number of lines in the transcript file should match lines in fileids file
    Phase 5: Determine amount of training data, see if n_tied_states seems reasonable.
        Estimated Total Hours Training: 0.0399638888888889
        This is a small amount of data, no comment at this time
    Phase 6: Checking that all the words in the transcript are in the dictionary
        Words in dictionary: 11
        Words in filler dictionary: 3
    Phase 7: Checking that all the phones in the transcript are in the phonelist, and all phones in the phonelist appear at least once
